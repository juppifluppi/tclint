# TC/L interaction probability model

This web application is not actively maintained anymore as the model is now integrated in our [new web application](https://muctcl.streamlit.app/) incorporating drug-bile with drug-mucin interactions!

Python web app and local command-line script to compute probability of interaction of a molecule with taurocholate/lecithin at pH 6.5, based on two descriptors: logD and CrippenMR. The model is inspired by [our previous study](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.2c00227) but was built with descriptors from rdkit/scopy instead of MOE/PaDEL, using logD for pH 7.4 instead of 7.0. For the same training/validation set similar statistics are retrieved (balanced accuracy: 0.86/0.83, AUC: 0.93/0.93). Similarities of the compound's properties (logD/CrippenMR) and chemical structure ([SDC applicability domain metric](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00597)) in relation to the training set are analyzed to further assess predictability.

## Web application

Streamlit web app ```tclint_streamlit.py``` is accessible at:

https://tclint.streamlit.app/

## Local command-line script

To use the command-line script ```tclint.py``` locally, run the following code in the downloaded folder:
```
python tclint.py "SMILESCODE" 
```
Instead of a single SMILES code, a ```*.dat``` file can be provided as input, with one SMILES code per line (without parentheses). In this case, the script outputs the properties for each molecule into ```tclint_results.dat```:
```
python tclint.py listofsmiles.dat 
```

Packages needed for running:
```
rdkit 2022.09.1
scopy 1.2.5
dimorphite-dl 1.3.2
numpy 1.23.4
```

## Conda program installation from source

The model can be installed as program in a new conda environment with all the necessary packages listed above in the following way:

1. (go to your local ~/anaconda3/envs/ directory)
2. ```git clone https://github.com/juppifluppi/tclint.git```
3. ```cd tclint```
4. ```conda env create -f env.yml```
5. ```conda activate tclint```
6. ```pip install -e .```

You can then use the alias tclint:
```
tclint "SMILESCODE" 
tclint listofsmiles.dat
```

## Databases of original models for TC/L and lipid interactions

Alternatively, ```db_enamine.html``` and ```db_zinc.html``` contain already calculated TC/L and lipid interaction probabilities for drug molecules with the original models 2 and 3 from the publication, using MOE/PaDEL descriptors (not manually inspected for correct protonation!).

```db_enamine.html```: Enamine FDA approved drug collection (07.08.2022)

```db_zinc.html```: ZINC DrugBank (20.02.18)
